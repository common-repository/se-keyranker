Below is a basic tutorial on using SE KeyRanker Free!/Pro. Alternatively you can view our [video tutorial here](http://www.screencast.com/users/WayneOS/folders/Jing/media/13054e9a-85ad-44f0-9624-4d92c915dd68 "SE KeyRanker Video Tutorial").

1. Click on menu title SE KeyRanker on the left in your wordpress admin.
2. The Keyword Management will open, simply add your keyword phrases and submit. Please note that you can click on the X next to each keyword to delete them.
3. In the SE KeyRanker menu selection, click on settings.
5. Click Localization within the Google box.
6. Tick the boxes of the Localization options you wish to use and then click save. We recommend .com to start with.
7. Click on your dashboard and click Refresh to see your results in the SE KeyRanker box!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the number next to the localization? =

The number displayed is the position your site returned in the search rankings for your specific keyword.

= I changed a setting but see no change? =

After adjusting any settings you'll need to click the refresh button found under your results on the dashboard.

= My site placement is different in my browser than to SE KeyRankers results, what's broken? =

Nothing is broken. Aside from localization selection, where your site is hosted determines what data centre will be used to return the results. Therefore you may notice a slight difference in results when using other methods to check your rankings.

= Why are my results displayed as N/A? =

If your site isn't within the first 100 results for your select keyword the result returns N/A - Not Available. Also please note that if you record your data and view your keyword average, N/A recordings are ignored.

= How many localization domains can I add at once? =

No limit is currently placed on how many domains can be placed but it's recommended to use localization settings sparingly to avoid long load times or being temporary blocked by Google for too many searches.

= How many keywords can I add? =

SE KeyRanker Free! is currently limited to only three keywords.

= What happens to my saved data if I delete a keyword? =

Deleting a keyword deletes all recorded data for that phrase. Be sure to export before removing a keyword!

= Help! It tells me Google has blocked me! What's happening? =

In the event your results have been blocked by Google, please bear in mind this is not a limitation of the plugin but a security measure by Google that is unavoidable.

The reasons you might have been temporary blocked can be any of the following:

* Too many localizations selected.
* You've clicked refresh too often.
* You have too many sites hosted on the same ip address all using SE KeyRanker to refresh within a short timeframe.

Please be aware that there is no long term penality for this temporary block but we recommend the following:

1. Avoid more than 4 Google Localizations at a time.
2. Don't click refresh repeatedly non-stop, your results won't differ second to second.
3. If you have many sites on the same ip domain, install SE KeyRanker at different intervals to spread out your auto-refresh timer.

== Screenshots ==

1. SE KeyRanker sits on your dashboard neatly for quick reference to your site performance.
2. Easy to use Keyword Management.
3. Adjust your settings and localization.
4. View your saved data for individual breakdowns or calculated averages.
5. Export data in CSV file format.
